# Design a word guessing game that takes input from two users
# User1 enters word to be guessed.
# User2 tries to guess that word.
# All matching letters from the guessed word will be displayed.
# Chances are equal to the length of the word to be guessed.
# Game ends when chances are equal to zero.
# The word to be guessed is compared to the guessed word to compare.
# Matching letters are displayed.
# If word is not guessed in the number of allowed tries, user2 loses.
# If word is guessed, user1 wins and word is displayed.
