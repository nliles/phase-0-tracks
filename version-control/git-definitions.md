# Git Definitions

Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that allows you to manage changes to files over time, allowing you to access the history of the changes. When you use git commit it puts these changes into a local repository. It is useful because it allows you to review the changes that were made over time.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in git points back to a commit. The master branch in git is called master. A branch is useful because it allows you to make changes and discard features without having to merge it back to the master branch. It allows you to experiment and play around with things.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A git commit records changes to a local repository. A good commit message is one that is detailed and states the changes made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when git cannot merge your current branch with the branch you want to merge into your current branch. This usually occurs when there are disagreeing changes between the two branches that git could not resolve.
